# Mobile-Sales-Performance
I developed a comprehensive project in Power BI, designed to analyze and visualize mobile sales performance across different dimensions such as brand, model, city, payment method, and time.

The objective of this project is to design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides actionable insights into mobile sales performance. The dashboard aims to:

Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, transactions, quantity, and average price.

Enable business users to analyze sales by city, brand, and mobile model.

Identify customer behavior patterns through payment method preferences and ratings.

Monitor monthly and daily sales trends to support strategic decision-making.

Provide a visual and data-driven tool for stakeholders to optimize sales strategies and improve business outcomes.
